Overview
========

This repo has a single purpose: To compile unofficial binaries of 
the BitcoinSV dpp-proxy (https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/dpp-proxy). 
Namely for usage in the [ElectrumSV SDK](https://pypi.org/project/electrumsv-sdk) 
which aims to provide a first-class RegTest developer experience for running local
(or cloud / pipelines-based) services that many bitcoin applications depend on.
